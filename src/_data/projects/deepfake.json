Now, how do you create a video of a person that does not exist?<br><br>To tackle this problem I was tasked with, I started out by firstly generating a portrait of a 'new' person using the tried and true StyleGAN. <br> I then fed this single portrait image, after trying out various other uncompelling options, into my workflow - consisting of a state of the art face swapper - along with the source video to generate a low resolution deepfake. Using a face restorer model to upscale the face again, I was able to create a quite convincing final result. <br><br>Of course the result isn't perfect: We get a few jitters, mainly in the hair due to the face restoring; I also put it under a hard test with the dance video, and as expected it struggles with objects in front of the face which I highlighted in the slow-motion. Still, the harsh and quick lighting changes were no issue, and I as well as the client are satisfied with the result. <br>The videos seen here are only examples I created to show off the process to comply with the NDA.",

The footage we had available was still in black and white, which some of the models didn't cope well with - a great opportunity to also test out video colorization methods! After lots of trial and error (and a *ton* of conda and venv environments later), I was able to design a workflow that worked best for the goal in mind.",

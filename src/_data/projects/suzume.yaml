description: 'After watching my now favorite movie of all time, I was left awestruck (and bawling my eyes out) in a way that I <i>had</i> to show my appreciation for it in one way or another. What followed was a project that took me on a two-year journey of learning and growth, both personally and professionally. Using all of the programs I had learned over the years as well as writing not one, but two Python plugins to help me with the project (and are now also helping hundreds of other artists), I created a short animation that I am incredibly proud of. The project was a labor of love, and I hope it does the original work justice.'

          Makoto Shinkai’s Suzume is a whirlwind adventure featuring a three-legged chair, a mischievous cat deity, and an overarching theme of grief, healing, and closure. The film blends jaw-dropping visuals with themes of trauma and resilience, all while weaving in Japanese folklore. It’s heartfelt without being heavy-handed and quirky without losing its depth, and has both earned the spot as my favorite movie and served inspiration for this project.

          Seeing as this project took quite some time (on and off two years), the style evolved rather a bit. Going from the whimsical, summer-like bright turquoise in the beginning - just like the inspiration -, turning more into the muddy, darker vibe of the abandoned mall. I believe this emphasizes the feeling of getting pulled into the Other Side of the door and makes for a more rounded palette. 

          What I like about these Work-In-Progress images is how they show the evolution of the project, especially how the composition is built; growing hand in hand with the lighting changes to underline where the viewer's eye should be drawn to.

      If you're a certified gamer, you might recognize the scene's background being eerily similar to the mall level in The Last Of Us: Part 2 (just less aquatic). However, this "model" that I was handed had two big problems:
      a) All Instances of Objects were'nt cloned, but separate objects (inefficient as hell with about 10.000 objects), and
      b) No materials were assigned and I was only handed a folder with a ton of raw texture files - with the normal maps in Red-Green format.

      The most glaring problem - the missing textures - was quite a task to behold. Hundreds of materials missing and nearly a thousand texture files just dumped into a single folder. To solve this, I spent a few weeks writing a plugin for Cinema4D that makes importing materials for Redshift materials super easy using a little black magic and RegEx; I won't get into the details here, since  <a href=' https://jeromestephan.de/blog_posts/textomato/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> I've already written a blog post all about how it works and about writing a plugin for C4D in general →</a> .

      This took away all of the hassle of manually creating each texture and the problem was solved in a single click! I can't recommend TexToMatO enough if you're using C4D together with Redshift, and (shameless self-advertisement aside) hundreds of others think the same,  <a href=' https://jeromestephan.gumroad.com/l/TexToMatO' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> check it out on my Gumroad if you're interested →</a> .

      - text: 'A normal map helps to create surface & lighting detail without having to go out and have models with a high polygon count everywhere. It does so in specifying the vector perpendicular to the surface (which we call the normal) by giving each of the vector''s X, Y and Z direction a corresponding Red, Green and Blue value. Game models use this technique abundantly to get up to sweet sweet smooth framerates making low-poly models still look great. However, they use another trick to save on even more storage space: They simply leave out the "Blue" component of the normal map. How is that possible?'

I realized that every single object in the scene was, well, a real, modeled object, while in truth they were thousands upon thousands of clones of just a handful of plant models. To optimize, C4D offers the concept of Instances, which load the object in memory just once and then copy-pastes the same model at each instance''s location; an insane speed-up, if the scene were optimized in this way. Having gotten the hang of writing plugins, I booted up my code editor of choice and wrote away: A program which transforms each object into an independent matrix, then hashes the positions of its points and other attributes to be able to quickly identify it using this hash. Whew, quite the technical jargon to behold, but worry not, it can be simply explained by black magic.'

I booted up Houdini, loaded in the simulation and managed to smoothly make each simulated line return to its starting position using just a few simple nodes; then using this modified sim in C4D as a driver for the hair.'

It also features a handy tool to make the volume sim looping inside of a certain time area, which coupled with the quite simple setup I had going on made for a nice, quick and pretty cloud.'

In anime, objects standing inside water sometimes emit water ripples for no discernible reason other than looking cool, so I created a shallow water solver in Houdini with the relevant geometry as a collision map, then emitting from said map a little bit of water in periodic intervals. After cleaning up the simulation and making it loop, I brought it back into C4D to make the water a little bit more lively.'

      Closing out, I additionally rendered out the depth map as well as the Volumetric components of the image for some nice post-processing in Nuke. I used the depth map for some dust particle animations and to create some subtle camera shake by reprojecting the render onto a 3D-extrusion using the depth map to get the shake to behave more realistically - moving closer objects more than far away ones. 
      After some more color grading I set up some sound effects and played the musical motif of the movie on the piano, bringing it all together in Ableton to round off the project with some ample soundscape.

      All in all, I am really proud of this render, bringing together nearly all of my skills in the different softwares I have learned over my years in this awesome creative outlet, as well as writing two plugins which are now used happily by hundreds of other artists around the globe. This has been a superb journey which - I hope - can be inspiring for others to keep on creating and doing what you love. 
      Thank you for sticking with me to the end, and I encourage you to scroll back up and watch the final animation again, maybe you'll spot some things I wrote about or at least have a little more knowledge of what it took to get there. See you on the other side!

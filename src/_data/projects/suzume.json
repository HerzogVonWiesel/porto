    "description": "After watching my now favorite movie of all time, I was left awestruck (and bawling my eyes out) in a way that I <i>had</i> to show my appreciation for it in one way or another. What followed was a project that took me on a two-year journey of learning and growth, both personally and professionally. Using all of the programs I had learned over the years as well as writing not one, but two Python plugins to help me with the project (and are now also helping hundreds of other artists), I created a short animation that I am incredibly proud of. The project was a labor of love, and I hope it does the original work justice.",

I'm sure of it.</i><br><br> Makoto Shinkai’s Suzume is a whirlwind adventure featuring a three-legged chair, a mischievous cat deity, and an overarching theme of grief, healing, and closure. The film blends jaw-dropping visuals with themes of trauma and resilience, all while weaving in Japanese folklore. It’s heartfelt without being heavy-handed and quirky without losing its depth, and has both earned the spot as my favorite movie and served inspiration for this project.",
